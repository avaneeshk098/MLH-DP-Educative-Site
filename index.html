                <p class="mt-3 px-5 fs-5">Dynamic Programming (DP) is an algorithmic technique for solving an optimization problem by breaking it down into simpler subproblems and utilizing the fact that the optimal solution to the overall problem depends upon the optimal solution to its subproblems.</p>
                <img src="./dp1.png" class="px-5 pt-3">
                <p class="px-5 pt-4 fs-5">Before moving on to understand different methods of solving a DP problem, letâ€™s first take a look at what are the characteristics of a problem that tells us that we can apply DP to solve it.</p>
                <p class="px-5 text-primary fs-4">
                    1. Overlapping subproblems
                </p>
                <p class="px-5 fs-5">
                    Subproblems are smaller versions of the original problem. Any problem has overlapping sub-problems if finding its solution involves solving the same subproblem multiple times.
                </p>
                <p class="px-5 text-primary fs-4">
                    2. Optimal Substructure Property
                </p>
                <p class="px-5 fs-5">
                    Any problem has optimal substructure property if its overall optimal solution can be constructed from the optimal solutions of its subproblems. 
                </p>

            <div id="fibo" class="content bg-light px-5">
                <h1 class="text-primary display-5 fw-bold">Fibonacci Sequence Problem</h1>
                <p class="pt-4 fs-5">Now letâ€™s take the example of the Fibonacci numbers. As we all know, Fibonacci numbers are a series of numbers in which each number is the sum of the two preceding numbers. The first few Fibonacci numbers are</p> <pre class="text-info px-4
                    py-3 rounded-3 bg-dark">0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8,......</pre> 
                <p class="fs-5">and they continue on from there.</p>
                <p class="pt-3 fs-5">So, the general formula to calculate the n<sup>th</sup> Fibonacci number would be:</p>
                <pre class="text-info px-4
                py-3 rounded-3 bg-dark">Fib(n) = Fib(n-1) + Fib(n-2), for n > 1</pre>
                <p class="fs-5">Here is a recursive tree of how the 4<sup>th</sup> fibonacci number should be calculate.</p>
                <img src="fib.png" class="w-100 shadow-lg rounded-3 img-thumbnail"/>
                <p class="mt-4 fs-5">Upon doing the time complexity analysis of this method of calculating the n<sup>th</sup> Fibonacci number, we find that is is <em>O(2<sup>n</sup>)</em> A.K.A exponential growth. If you don't understand what is the big-O notation you can read more <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_O_notation" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
                <p class="fs-4">Now the question arises how do we optimise this?</p>
                <p class="fs-5">If you look carefully you would notice that we are calculating numbers like <i>fib(2)</i>, <i>fib(1)</i>, etc. multiple times. So, the best optimisation would be to not calculate them again and again, instead to calculate them once and store them in an array to reused later.</p>
                <p class="fs-4"> 
                This process of storing a previous computation for a subproblem and using it to find answer to the main problem is called <em>memoization</em>.</p>
                <p class="fs-5">In terms of code if we have an array, <kbd>fib[n]</kbd> where <kbd>n</kbd> is the position of the n<sup>th</sup> Fibonacci number. The code for this in C++ would be:</p>
                <script src="https://gist.github.com/avaneeshk098/3d6a0998d02254630b84ccb8024c576c.js"></script>
            </div>
            <div id="lis" class="bg-light py-5 content px-5">
                <h1 class="display-5 fw-bold text-primary">Longest Increasing Subsequence</h1>
                <p class="pt-4 fs-5">
                    We are given an array with n numbers: <kbd>a[0â€¦nâˆ’1]</kbd><br/> The task is to find the length of the longest, strictly increasing, subsequence in <kbd>a</kbd>
                </p>
                <p class="fs-5">
                    To accomplish this task we define an array <kbd>d[0...n-1]</kbd>, where <kbd>d[i]</kbd> is the length of the longest increasing subsequence that ends in the element at index i. We will compute this array gradually first <kbd>d[0]</kbd>, then <kbd>d[1]</kbd>, and so on. After all the values are computed the answer is the maximum value in <kbd>d</kbd>
                </p>
                <p class="fs-5">
                    Now that we understand the problem and have a basic idea on how the solution would be, the next step is to form a recurrence relation! In this case the recurrence relation would be divided on the basis of two cases:
                    <pre class="text-info px-4
                    py-3 rounded-3 bg-dark">d[i] = 1: the required subsequence consisrs of only the element a[i]</pre>
                    <pre class="text-info px-4
                    py-3 rounded-3 bg-dark">d[i] > 1: if there are is an index j=0...i-1, if a[j] < a[i], then d[i] = max(d[i], d[j]+1)</pre>
                </p>
                <p class="fs-5">Now that we have our recurrence ready, let's write the C++ code for the same.</p>
